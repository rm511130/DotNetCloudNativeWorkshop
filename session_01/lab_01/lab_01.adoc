= Lab 1 - Pushing Your First Application

[abstract]
--
In this lab we will push a .NET web application to cloud foundry using the CF CLI. You must have completed Lab 0 successfully in order to proceed with Lab 1.
--

== Download code

. Clone the following git repo: https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/pcf-dotnet-environment-viewer
+
----
> cd /work
> git clone https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/pcf-dotnet-environment-viewer
----

== Target

. If you haven't already, set the API target for the CLI, please set the appropriate end point for your environment using the cf api command as shown here:
+
----
> cf api api.system.pcf4u.com --skip-ssl-validation
----
and login to Pivotal Cloudfoundry:
+
----
> cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts. 

== Push It!

. Change to the _ViewEnvironment_ application directory. This is the folder containing the code files and manifest.yml
+
----
> cd pcf-dotnet-environment-viewer/ViewEnvironment
> cat manifest.yml

---
applications:
- name: env
  host: env-${random-word}
  memory: 512m
  stack: windows2012R2
  buildpack: binary_buildpack

----

. Push the application!
+
----
> cf push
----
+
You should see output similar to the following log.
+
====
----
> cf push

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, the stack to be used (in this case Windows2012R2), the number of instances requested to start, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _env_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `app.system.pcf4u.com` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/devguide/deploy-apps/blue-green.html[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Notice that it's uploading _39 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually uploads all the files for the deployment for caching purposes.
<6> Now we begin the staging process. By choosing the Windows2012R2 stack a container is created on the runtime to prepare the application to run, a second container is then generated that will host your application...in this case using the WebAppServer process in Windows.  If you want to try with other languages you can push an application on the Linux stack.
<7> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more Cells in the _https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-9/concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html[Diego Architecture]_ for execution.
<8> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<9> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
====

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
> cf apps
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing:
+
----
> cf apps
Getting apps in org student-42 / space development as student-42...
OK

name                  requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls

----
+

Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
+
----
> cf app env
----
+

You should see output similar to the following listing:
+

. Stop the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
> cf stop env
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing:
+
----
> cf stop env
Stopping app env in org student-42 / space development as student-42...
OK
----
+

. Delete the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
> cf delete env
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing:
+
----
> cf delete env
Really delete the app env?> yes
Deleting app env in org student-42 / space development as student-42...
OK
----
+
.
== Congratulations. You have completed Lab 1 by pushing Your First .NET Application to Cloud Foundry
